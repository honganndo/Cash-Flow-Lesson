# Cash-Flow-Lesson
## Website with lessons designed to teach people about a cashflow statement in 10 minutes. They can take a quiz to test their knowledge after going through the lessons. 

### Created as a final project for Columbia University's COMS4170 User Interface Design class taught by Professor Lydia Chilton. 
### Other project contributors for learning portion of website: Bonny Quan and Camerie Mazreku 
### I designed and implemented the quiz portion, redesigned some of the learning portion, and cleaned up the code in the learning portion.
